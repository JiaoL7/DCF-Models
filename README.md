# DCF-Models
This folder consists of custom built Discounted Cash Flow models that include multiple scenarios (Based/Street, Conservative, Optimistic & Manual Case). Feel free to change the assumptions to your liking, all modifiable variables are on the unlocked cells. I welcome all questions, feedback, and constructive criticism. Please don't hesitate to reach out if you have any request to value a specific stock. Have Fun! 
 
 
 
Disclaimers:

This is just one point of reference for your own analysis and research; NOT financial advice. A "real" DCF would involve a lot more time / research put into each assumptions that retail investors don't have access to. For me, I use DCFs to see "what I need to believe" based on street assumptions + ranges in order to see what "fair prices" are. Markets move fast, so assumptions can change overnight. Please don't get married to the numbers I show.
