# DCF-Models
This folder consists of custom built Discounted Cash Flow models that include multiple scenarios (Based/Street, Conservative, Optimistic & Manual Case). Feel free to change the assumptions to your liking and modifiable cells are unlocked. I welcome all questions, feedback, and constructive criticism. Please don't hesitate to reach out if you have any request to value a specific stock. Have Fun! 

Disclaimers
This is just one point of reference for your own analysis and research; NOT financial advice. 
A "real" DCF would involve a lot more time / research put into each assumptions + range in order to see what "fair prices" are.
